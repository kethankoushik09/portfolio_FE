          ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm <strong>Kethan Gaikwad</strong>, a B.Tech 2025 graduate and a passionate Full Stack Developer. I specialize in creating responsive, dynamic, and user-friendly web applications using modern technologies like React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Over the past few years, I have built several projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to interactive web apps, focusing on clean code, efficient performance. Each project has strengthened my problem-solving skills and my ability to turn ideas into practical, scalable solutions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Beyond coding, I am a basketball player, which has taught me teamwork, dedication, and disciplineâ€”qualities I carry into my development work. I enjoy exploring new technologies, collaborating on exciting projects, and continuously learning to grow as a developer.
